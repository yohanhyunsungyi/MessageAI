## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### OnboardingView Key Features

**UI Components:**
- Gradient background (blue → purple)
- Circular profile photo with camera icon overlay
- PhotosPicker with pencil icon button
- Display name text field
- Get Started button with loading state
- Helper text for user guidance

**State Management:**
```swift
@State private var displayName: String = ""
@State private var selectedPhoto: PhotosPickerItem?
@State private var profileImage: UIImage?
@State private var photoURL: String?
@State private var isUploading = false
@State private var showError = false
@State private var errorMessage: String = ""
```

**Photo Processing:**
```swift
private func loadPhoto(from item: PhotosPickerItem?) async {
    // 1. Load transferable data
    // 2. Create UIImage
    // 3. Resize to 300x300 (performance optimization)
    // 4. Convert to JPEG (0.7 compression)
    // 5. Encode to base64 string
    // 6. Update UI with preview
}
```

**Image Resizing:**
```swift
private func resizeImage(_ image: UIImage, targetSize: CGSize) -> UIImage? {
    // Maintain aspect ratio
    // Scale down to max 300x300
    // Reduce memory footprint
    // Improve upload performance
}
```

**Form Validation:**
```swift
private var isFormValid: Bool {
    !displayName.trimmingCharacters(in: .whitespaces).isEmpty
}
```

**Profile Completion:**
```swift
private func completeOnboarding() {
    Task {
        do {
            try await authService.completeOnboarding(
                displayName: displayName.trimmingCharacters(in: .whitespaces),
                photoURL: photoURL
            )
            // AuthService automatically sets needsOnboarding = false
            // App transitions to MainTabView
        } catch {
            errorMessage = error.localizedDescription
            showError = true
        }
    }
}
```

## 🎨 UI/UX Design

### Layout Structure
```
OnboardingView
├── Background Gradient (blue → purple)
├── Welcome Section
│   ├── Person Icon (80pt)
│   ├── "Welcome!" Title
│   └── "Let's set up your profile" Subtitle
├── Form Section
│   ├── Profile Photo Picker
│   │   ├── Circular Image Preview (120x120)
│   │   └── Edit Button (PhotosPicker)
│   ├── Display Name Input
│   │   ├── Label
│   │   └── TextField (white background)
│   ├── Get Started Button
│   │   └── Loading indicator (when uploading)
│   └── Helper Text
└── Error Alert
```

### Design Decisions
1. **Gradient Background:** Consistent with AuthView for visual continuity
2. **Circular Photo:** Standard profile picture format
3. **Optional Photo:** Reduces friction, users can skip and add later
4. **Validation Feedback:** Button disabled until form is valid
5. **Loading States:** Visual feedback during upload and profile creation
6. **Error Handling:** Clear error messages for photo upload failures

## 🔄 User Flow

### New User Journey
```
1. User signs up/signs in with Google
   ↓
2. AuthService checks if user profile exists
   ↓ (if not exists)
3. needsOnboarding = true
   ↓
4. App shows OnboardingView
   ↓
5. User enters display name
   ↓ (optional)
6. User selects profile photo
   ↓
7. Photo resized and encoded
   ↓
8. User taps "Get Started"
   ↓
9. AuthService.completeOnboarding() called
   ↓
10. User document created in Firestore
    ↓
11. needsOnboarding = false
    ↓
12. App shows MainTabView (placeholder for PR #9)
```

### Existing User Journey
```
1. User signs in
   ↓
2. AuthService loads existing profile
   ↓
3. needsOnboarding = false
   ↓
4. App shows MainTabView directly
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Build Status
- ✅ **Clean Build:** Successfully compiles with no errors
- ✅ **Linter:** No linter errors
- ✅ **Target:** iOS 26.0+
- ✅ **Simulator:** iPhone 16 tested

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Sign up with email → Onboarding screen appears
- [ ] Sign in with Google (new user) → Onboarding screen appears
- [ ] Enter display name → Get Started button enables
- [ ] Leave display name empty → Get Started button disabled
- [ ] Select photo → Preview appears
- [ ] Complete onboarding → Profile created in Firestore
- [ ] Sign out and sign in again → No onboarding (existing user)
- [ ] Test with very large image → Resized correctly
- [ ] Test photo picker cancellation → No errors

## 📝 Implementation Notes

### Photo Storage Approach (MVP)
For the MVP, photos are stored as base64 strings directly in the User document. This is a simple approach with trade-offs:

**Pros:**
- No additional Firebase Storage setup needed
- Works immediately
- Simple to implement

**Cons:**
- Base64 encoding increases size by ~33%
- Firestore has 1MB document limit
- Not optimal for production at scale

**Future Enhancement (Post-MVP):**
Implement Firebase Storage integration:
```swift
// Upload to Firebase Storage
let storageRef = Storage.storage().reference()
let photoRef = storageRef.child("profile_photos/\(uid).jpg")
let uploadTask = photoRef.putData(imageData)

// Get download URL
let downloadURL = try await photoRef.downloadURL()

// Store URL in Firestore (not base64)
user.photoURL = downloadURL.absoluteString
```

### Image Resizing Rationale
- **Target Size:** 300x300 pixels
- **Compression:** 0.7 JPEG quality
- **Typical Size:** ~30-50KB per image
- **Benefit:** Fast uploads, reduced bandwidth, smaller Firestore documents

### Existing Service Reuse
The `completeOnboarding()` method was already implemented in AuthService (PR #5), so we simply:
1. Called the existing method from OnboardingView
2. Leveraged existing Firestore integration
3. Relied on existing state management (`needsOnboarding` flag)

This demonstrates good architectural planning from earlier PRs.

## 🔗 Integration Points

### AuthService Integration
```swift
// OnboardingView calls:
try await authService.completeOnboarding(
    displayName: displayName,
    photoURL: photoURL
)

// AuthService creates User document in Firestore:
let user = User(
    id: uid,
    displayName: displayName,
    photoURL: photoURL,
    phoneNumber: nil,
    isOnline: true,
    lastSeen: Date(),
    fcmToken: nil,
    createdAt: Date()
)

try firestore.collection("users").document(uid).setData(from: user)
```

### App Flow Integration
```swift
// messageAIApp.swift
if authService.isAuthenticated {
    if authService.needsOnboarding {
        OnboardingView()
            .environmentObject(authService)
    } else {
        // MainTabView (PR #9)
    }
} else {
    AuthView()
        .environmentObject(authService)
}
```
