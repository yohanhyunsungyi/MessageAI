## How to Test Push Notifications

### Step 1: Build on Real iOS Device
```bash
# Simulators don't support push notifications!
# Connect your iPhone and select it in Xcode
# Product ‚Üí Run (‚åòR)
```

### Step 2: Grant Permission
- App will request notification permission on first launch
- Tap **"Allow"**
- Check Xcode console for: "‚úÖ Notification permissions granted"

### Step 3: Verify FCM Token Registration
Look for this in Xcode console:
```
üì± FCM token received: <long-token-string>
‚úÖ FCM token registered for user: <user-id>
```

### Step 4: Send Test Message

**Option A: From Another Device/Account**
1. Sign in with a different account on another device
2. Send a message to your test account
3. Watch for notification

**Option B: Using Firebase Console**
1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/messagingai-75f21/notification
2. Click **"Send your first message"**
3. Enter notification title and text
4. Select your iOS app
5. Click **"Send test message"**
6. Paste your FCM token (from Xcode console)
7. Click **"Test"**

### Step 5: Verify Function Execution

Watch the logs in real-time:
```bash
# In your terminal
firebase functions:log --only sendMessageNotification

# You should see:
# üì¨ New message created in conversation: xxx
# üë• Notifying 1 recipient(s)
# ‚úì Token found for user: xxx
# üì§ Sending notifications to 1 device(s)
# ‚úÖ Notification sent successfully
```

### Background Notifications (App Closed)
- [ ] Completely close the app (swipe up in app switcher)
- [ ] Have friend send you a message
- [ ] **Expected:** Push notification appears on lock screen
- [ ] Tap notification
- [ ] **Expected:** App opens to that conversation

### Active Chat Suppression
- [ ] Open a chat with User A

## Monitoring & Debugging

### View Function Logs
```bash
# Watch logs in real-time
firebase functions:log --only sendMessageNotification

# View all function logs
firebase functions:log
```

### Check Firebase Console

**Functions Dashboard:**
https://console.firebase.google.com/project/messagingai-75f21/functions/list

**Cloud Messaging:**
https://console.firebase.google.com/project/messagingai-75f21/notification

**Usage & Billing:**
https://console.firebase.google.com/project/messagingai-75f21/usage/details

### Verify in Firestore

Check that FCM tokens are being saved:
1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/messagingai-75f21/firestore
2. Navigate to: `users/{your-user-id}`
3. Check field: `fcmToken` should have a value

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "No valid FCM tokens found"

**Symptom:** Function runs but doesn't send notifications

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check Firestore for FCM token
# Go to: Firestore ‚Üí users ‚Üí {userId} ‚Üí fcmToken

# If missing, check Xcode console for:
# "‚úÖ FCM token registered"

# If not showing, call registerToken manually in app
```

### Issue: Notifications work in foreground, not background

**Symptom:** See banner when app open, nothing when closed

**Solution:**
1. Check Xcode ‚Üí Target ‚Üí Signing & Capabilities
2. Verify **"Push Notifications"** is enabled
3. Verify **"Background Modes"** ‚Üí "Remote notifications" is checked
4. Rebuild and reinstall app

### Issue: Function not triggering

**Symptom:** No logs when sending messages

**Solution:**
```bash
# Verify function is deployed
firebase functions:list

# Should show sendMessageNotification

# If not listed, redeploy:
firebase deploy --only functions
```

### Issue: "APNs delivery failed"

**Symptom:** Function sends but notification doesn't arrive

**Solution:**
1. Verify APNs key is uploaded to Firebase Console
2. Check Key ID and Team ID are correct
3. Rebuild app with correct entitlements
4. Ensure using real device (not simulator)

## Performance Metrics

### Expected Performance

**Function Execution Time:**
- Average: 1-2 seconds
- Max: 5 seconds

**Cost (within free tier):**
- 1,000 messages/day: $0/month
- 10,000 messages/day: $0/month
- 100,000 messages/day: ~$0.50/month

**Free Tier Limits:**
- 2,000,000 invocations/month
- You'd need ~66,000 messages/day to exceed this!

### Monitor Usage
```bash
# View function execution count
firebase functions:log --only sendMessageNotification | grep "New message created" | wc -l

# View recent errors
firebase functions:log --only sendMessageNotification | grep "‚ùå"
```
