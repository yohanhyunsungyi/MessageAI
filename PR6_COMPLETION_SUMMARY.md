## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### SwiftUI Best Practices
```swift
// Observable object pattern
@ObservedObject var viewModel: AuthViewModel

// Focus state management
@FocusState private var focusedField: Field?

// Conditional rendering
if showSignUp {
    SignUpView(viewModel: viewModel)
} else {
    SignInView(viewModel: viewModel)
}
```

### Custom Components
```swift
// Reusable text field style
struct AuthTextFieldStyle: TextFieldStyle {
    // White background, rounded corners
}
```

### User Experience
- **Instant Feedback:** Form validation in real-time
- **Loading States:** Progress indicators during async operations
- **Error Messages:** User-friendly alerts
- **Smooth Transitions:** Animated view switches
- **Keyboard Management:** Focus state and submit actions

## 📊 Code Quality

### Best Practices

- ✅ SwiftUI conventions (View protocol, @State, @ObservedObject)
- ✅ Focus management with @FocusState
- ✅ Keyboard handling (submitLabel, onSubmit)
- ✅ Accessibility (semantic labels)
- ✅ Error handling with user-friendly messages

### Code Organization
```
Views/Auth/
├── AuthView.swift (entry point)
├── SignInView.swift (sign in form)
└── SignUpView.swift (sign up form)
```
