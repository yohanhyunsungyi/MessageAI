# PR #28: Decision Tracking âœ…

Implements AI-powered decision extraction from conversations, allowing teams to track key decisions made in chat threads.

## Summary

This PR adds the 5th core AI feature: **Decision Tracking**. Users can now:
- Extract decisions from conversation threads with one tap (ðŸ’¡ lightbulb button)
- View all decisions in a dedicated Decisions tab
- See full decision context, participants, and tags
- Track technical, product, timeline, and process decisions

## Features Implemented

### Backend (Cloud Functions)
- âœ… `extractDecisions` Cloud Function using OpenAI GPT-4 Turbo
- âœ… Structured output with function calling (EXTRACT_DECISIONS_SCHEMA)
- âœ… Stores decisions in `/decisions/` Firestore collection
- âœ… Rate limiting middleware applied
- âœ… Authentication and input validation
- âœ… Target: <4 seconds response time

### iOS App (Swift/SwiftUI)
- âœ… `Decision.swift` model with all required fields
- âœ… `DecisionsListView` with chronological grouping (Today, Yesterday, This Week)
- âœ… `DecisionDetailView` with full context display
- âœ… Real-time Firestore listeners for live updates
- âœ… Track Decision button in ChatView (lightbulb icon ðŸ’¡)
- âœ… New Decisions tab in MainTabView
- âœ… `extractDecisions()` method in AIService

### Infrastructure
- âœ… Firestore security rules for `/decisions/` collection
- âœ… IAM permissions configured for function invocation
- âœ… Cloud Function deployed to us-central1

## Technical Details

**Decision Extraction:**
- Analyzes up to 200 messages per conversation
- Extracts: summary, context, participants, tags
- Categories: technical, product, timeline, process
- Stores with conversationId, conversationName, timestamp

**Data Model:**
```swift
struct Decision {
    let id: String
    let summary: String               // Brief description of decision
    let context: String               // Why decision was made
    let participants: [String]        // People involved
    let tags: [String]                // Categories
    let conversationId: String        // Source conversation
    let conversationName: String      // Display name
    let timestamp: Date               // When extracted
    let createdBy: String             // "ai" or "user"
}
```

**UI/UX:**
- Lightbulb icon (ðŸ’¡) for better semantic meaning
- Grouped by date for easy browsing
- Tap any decision to view full details
- Empty states with helpful messaging
- Loading states with progress indicators

## Files Changed

- `messageAI/messageAI/Views/Decisions/DecisionsListView.swift` (183 lines)
- `messageAI/messageAI/Views/Decisions/DecisionDetailView.swift` (140 lines)

**Modified (5 files):**
- `backend/functions/index.js` - Added extractDecisions export
- `messageAI/messageAI/Services/AIService.swift` - Implemented extraction method
- `messageAI/messageAI/Views/Chat/ChatView.swift` - Added button and logic
- `messageAI/messageAI/Views/Main/MainTabView.swift` - Added Decisions tab
- `firestore.rules` - Added /decisions/ collection rules

## Testing

âœ… **Manual Testing Completed:**
- iOS app builds successfully (no errors)
- Cloud Functions deployed successfully
- Decision extraction working end-to-end
- Firestore security rules validated
- Real-time listeners functioning correctly
- Empty states and error handling verified

**Test Scenario:**
1. Create conversation with decision-making messages
2. Tap lightbulb button to extract decisions
3. View decisions in Decisions tab
4. Tap decision to see full details
5. Verify Firestore storage

## Performance

- **Build Time:** ~20 seconds
- **Deployment Time:** ~30 seconds
- **Extraction Time:** <4 seconds (target met)
- **Code Quality:** Build succeeded with only warnings (no errors)

## Deployment Status

- âœ… Cloud Function deployed to `us-central1`
- âœ… IAM permissions set (allUsers invoker role)
- âœ… Firestore rules deployed
- âœ… iOS app compiles and runs

## Breaking Changes

None. This is a new feature addition.

## Migration Notes

None required. New `/decisions/` collection created automatically.

## Follow-up Tasks
